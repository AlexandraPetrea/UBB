Problem:
	Consider a system to control a washing machine.
	The purpose of this system is to adjust the washing cycle(delicate, easy, normal, intens).
	The outside sensors give information about the texture of the clothes(very soft, soft, normal, resistant)
	and the capacity of the machine(small,medium,high).
	Compute the necessary cycle of washing.

Input:
	Clothes:
		very soft
		soft
		normal
		resistant
	Capacity:
		small
		normal 
		high
	
Output:
	Washing cycle:
		delicate
		easy
		normal
		intense
		
Algorithm:
